Mounting and Unmounting animations are done with the help on React-Transition-Group (Library for React Animations).I have used Express for the backend framework which makes creating REST API easier.There are 2 primary routes, one for Authorization, for Userâ€™s StatsI used JWT Token authentication system for implementing the auth part. The auth part is pretty standard which conists of simple GET and POST requests.The only significant part mentioning about the backend is the User Stats route to display average score, No. Of games played and Max Level as it required aggregation queries for the database ",

It has a separate backend for Authentication as the Github API didn't support CORS for auth. So I made a reverse proxy for Auth requests for returning the Auth token",
